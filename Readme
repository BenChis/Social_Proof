## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./Social_Proof_Desktop)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some layouts can be tricky to be set properly with img backgrounds, because fixing one issue results in another one. On the one hand if I narrow my screen the background fits, but the ratio of the margin around doesn´t. On the other hand the oppsoite approach the img doesn´t fit in my screen ratio. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I would like to to improve more in layouts and make them more accescible.
